# Spatial Data Visualization: Relation between Tweets related to CO2 and the ODIAC Fossil Fuel Emission Dataset (ODIAC 2020b)

   In this project I have made use of the ODIAC 2020b dataset. I have used QGIS to visualize this dataset in multiband color.Then I have extracted the 8000 tweets related to search keyword CO2 using Twitter API and plotted these tweets on the map made by the ODIAC Fossil Fuel Emission Dataset (ODIAC 2020b).

With the help of twitter API, we have extracted the tweets having precise location information from all the 8000 tweets searched. Thus we get the tweets on the map having precise geographic coordinates on the map, which are 130 points.
